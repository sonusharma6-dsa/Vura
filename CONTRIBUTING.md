## 📋 GSSoC '26 Rules

To ensure a smooth workflow and avoid chaotic review cycles, we enforce these repository guidelines strictly:

* **Issue Assignment First:** Look through the open repository issues. Comment on the issue you wish to work on. **Do not write code until a Project Admin or Mentor explicitly assigns it to you.**
* **3-Day PR SLA:** Once an issue is assigned, you have exactly **3 days** to submit your Pull Request. If you need an extension, ask in the comments; otherwise, it will be reassigned to keep development moving.
* **No Unsolicited PRs:** Pull Requests opened without an associated, assigned issue will be closed automatically with zero point allocation.

## 💻 Tech Stack & Design Rules

Vura has a highly intentional, minimalist production design layer. Submissions that break our core style rules or slow down database operations will not be accepted.

### 🛠️ Technical Baseline
* **Framework:** Next.js 14+ (App Router setup utilizing strict TypeScript types).
* **Styling:** Tailwind CSS integrated with Framer Motion for animations.
* **Database Layer:** MongoDB Atlas / PostgreSQL.

### 🎨 UI/UX & Formatting Guidelines
* **The Aesthetics:** We favor clean **Bento Grid** structures and ultra-clean whitespace. Do not introduce chaotic layouts or busy components.
* **Color Integrity:** Use Vura's established design token rules. Our core aesthetic is built around professional **teal-green gradients**. Do not introduce random hex codes or default Tailwind primary hues (like standard blues, purples, or neon accents) unless explicit UI issues ask for them.
* **Strict Code Quality:** Avoid using the `any` type fallback in TypeScript. Ensure every component is modular, typed, and cleanly destructured.
* **Database Overhead:** Optimize your asynchronous logic and database queries. Avoid triggering infinite re-renders that hammer API routes or generate loose, unindexed database fetches.
